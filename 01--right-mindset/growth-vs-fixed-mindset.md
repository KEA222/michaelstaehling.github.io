The fixed mindset is based on nature. It assumes one is born gifted or has natural talents and can't learn learn much more than what nature allows them or has given them.

The growth mindset is nurture based. It assumes everyone has the ability to learn if they wish. If the put effort, practice, and hard work into learning, anyone is capable of learning.

In high school I was most likely under the fixed mindset. School came easy for me and I never really had to apply myself. It wasn't until college that I actually had to study (at least alot more than I did in high school) for classes. The courses themselves weren't very hard it just required more studying than I was used to. Being of a fixed mindset, I didn't like to have to actually study.

I've come to a point in my life where I know I haven't used my full learning potential. I squandered my learning potential in high school and college. Now I want to see what I'm made of. I've always known I've been smart enough and furtunately been able to pick things up fairly quickly (for the most part) to allow me to do just about any career I want. Now I want to push my learning potential to the limit and challenge myself as much as possible. This cohort is an ideal situation to challenge myself like i've never challenged myself before.
